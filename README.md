# SMS_Spam_Detection
## Introduction
Developed and implemented a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system leveraging SMS data to accurately predict whether messages are spam or legitimate (ham). Employed advanced machine learning algorithms including multinomial naive Bayes, logistic regression, SVM, and decision trees to achieve optimal performance. Utilized a diverse range of data cleaning and processing techniques such as PorterStemmer, CountVectorizer, TFIDF Vectorizer, and WordnetLemmatizer to enhance model robustness. Notably, the integrated Word Embeddings methodology resulted in an outstanding accuracy rate of 97.84%.
